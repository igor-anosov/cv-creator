          Hi! I'm Ihor, a Frontend Developer focused on <strong>React</strong>, I build high-performance web applications using
          advanced front-end techniques. I think every application should work <strong>smooth and fast</strong> on web and mobile as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've developed a wide range of Single Page Applications for companies in Europe and the USA in
          <strong> <span style={{whiteSpace: "nowrap"}}>e-commerce</span></strong>, <strong>logistics</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, <strong>automotive</strong>,
          <strong> travel</strong>, <strong>TV streaming</strong>, <strong>hotel</strong>, and other industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In several projects I have directly contributed to <strong>business growth</strong> -
          such as boosting conversion rates (by 600%) and reducing application load times (by 75%, up to 1.8 sec).
          My experience in web development allows me to not only write efficient code but also bring valuable
          expertise in the performance, UX/UI, and accessibility optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
